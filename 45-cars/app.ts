/*
<<<<< Task No: 44 >>>>>
Cars: 
Write a function that stores information about a carInfo in a Object. 
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
Call the function with the required information and two other 
name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information 
was stored correctly.

    manufacturer: string,
    model: string,

) {
    const carInfo = {manufacturer, model};
    moreinfo.forEach(info => Object.assign(carInfo, info));
    console.table(carInfo);
}

// Call Function
